# Examples

This directory contains a number of different examples showing useful ways to
use pgxgen. They contain checked in versions of the generated code and an
`output.txt` file showing what they print so that you don't have to go to
the trouble of running them if you don't want to. Because it is checked in
when the example is first written, the generated code may not be entirely
up to date with the most recent master version of pgxgen.

## Instructions For Running

First, `cd` into the example directory, then set up the database

```bash
> createdb pgxgen_development
> psql pgxgen_development < db.sql
```

Make sure that `$DB_URL` is `postgres://localhost/pgxgen_development?sslmode=disable` either
by explicitly setting it in the environment with

```bash
export DB_URL=postgres://localhost/pgxgen_development?sslmode=disable
```

or by installing `direnv` and doing `direnv allow` at the repo root (this will `source` the
`.envrc` file).

Finally, run the program

```bash
> go run ./main.go
```

## List of Examples

### [Example: query](query)

This example shows how to configure a query to be run against the database.

### [Example: statement](statement)

This example shows how to configure a statement to be executed against the
database.

### [Example: extending_models](extending_models)

This example shows how to add methods containing business logic to the model
structs generated by `pgxgen`. This can help you avoid an error prone and labor
intensive manual translation from the model structs to an extra layer just so
you can define methods on the intermediate layer.

### [Example: upsert](upsert)

This example shows how to use the upsert interface that pgxgen will automatically
generate for each model struct generated from a table.

### [Example: id_in_set](id_in_set)

This example shows how to write a query that checks for set containment
using the `= ANY` idiom rather than the `IN` operator that is typically
used with other database interactivity libraries.

### [Example: include_specs](include_specs)

This example shows how to use include specs to tell pgxgen how to fill in
records which are associated with one another via foreign keys. Include specs
are the key to the way that pgxgen deals with associations.

### [Example: timestamps and soft deletion](timestamps)

This example shows how to make use of the automatic timestamp features that
pgxgen provides. You can ask pgxgen to automatically take care of keeping track
created at and updated at timestamps. Soft deletes are often implemented with
a timestamp rather than just a boolean flag, so pgxgen supports them using
similar machinery, which is also demonstrated in this example.

### [Example: query argument names](query_argument_names)

This example shows how to provide useful names for query arguments. You can also
provide useful names for query arguments by defining a stored function and telling
pgxgen to generate shims for it, but you may prefer to avoid the ceremony usually involved
in managing objects in a database.

### [Example: middleware](middleware)

This example shows how to inject middleware between the generated `PGClient` and the database
connection. This allows you to implement things like logging and tracing to see what queries
are getting run against the database.

### [Example: single_results](single_results)

This example shows how to write queries that return just a single row as a result using
the `single_result` configuration option. This is a small quality of life improvement over
having to unpack a slice each time you place a query.

### [Example: json_columns](json_columns)

This example shows how to ask pgxgen to generate conversion code between arbitrary go
types and `json` or `jsonb` types in postgres.

### [Example: nullable_query_arguments](nullable_query_arguments)

This example shows how to ask pgxgen to generate code which allows nils to be passed into
queries. By default, you can only pass concrete types like `string` and `int` into a
pgxgen query.

### [Example: uuid](uuid)

This example shows how to work postgres's `uuid` type using the `github.com/gofrs/uuid`
library. There is no uuid type in the go standard library, so you must use a third party
type. `pgxgen` does not want to force a hard dependency on any particular uuid library, so
you must explicitly configure a type override in order to work with uuids.
