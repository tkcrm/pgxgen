// package pgxgen defines types and functions used by both the code that the
// pgxgen cli program generates and client code.
//
// The `gen` subpackage contains the implementation of the code generator. This
// provides an alternative interface from the CLI program.
//
// The `include` subpackage defines include specs, which make it easier to work with
// nested objects.
